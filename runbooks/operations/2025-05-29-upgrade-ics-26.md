## RUNBOOK - upgrading ICS26Router contract

### Runbook
1. The facilitator sends signers the operation branch name.
2. Facilitator updates implementation address in the `deployments/<environment>/<chain>.json` and runs `just verify-deployment <environment> <chain_id>`
   1. If the address changed, the verification should fail
3. Signers should run `git pull && git checkout operation/0529-ics26router`.
4. The signers independently verify that the transaction contents contain the expected call by running `just schedule-ics26router-upgrade-params`. 
5. The signers independently verify that the transaction hashes match what is expected on their hardware wallets by running `just get_safe_hashes <safe_address> <nonce> <timelock_calldata_step4> <timelock_address>`
6. The facilitator collects signatures from the signers on Gnosis Safe
    - ** (!!) The signers should verify the Tenderly simulation from the Gnosis Safe UI. They should make sure that the domainHash matches what they are seeing in the blind-signing window on their hardware wallet**
7. After the timelock passes, the facilitator gathers parameters for the execute transaction proposal by calling `just timelock-upgrade-proxy`
8. The signers independently verify that the transaction contents contain the expected call by running `just execute-ics26router-upgrade-params`. 
9. The signers independently verify that the transaction hashes match what is expected on their hardware wallets by running `just get_safe_hashes <safe_address> <nonce> <timelock_calldata_step8> <timelock_address>`
10. The facilitator collects signatures from the signers on Gnosis Safe
    - ** (!!) The signers should verify the Tenderly simulation from the Gnosis Safe UI. They should make sure that the domainHash matches what they are seeing in the blind-signing window on their hardware wallet**
11. The facilitator submits and merges a pull request to `eureka-ops` to update the new canonical ICS26Transfer deployment address.
